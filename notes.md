# Tests

## Jan 30, 2022
Antennas: Wire
Power: default
Location: Noe Valley
Line of sight: no

Got about two blocks

## Feb 3, 2022, Test 1
Antennas: Mini 2dBi
Power: default
Location: Berkeley
Line of sight: no

Got about 2 blocks. Not a perfect comparison to Noe Valley since the terrain is different. All
subsequent tests to be carried out in Berkeley.

## Feb 3, 2022, Test 2
Antennas: 5dBi
Power: default
Location: Berkeley
Line of sight: no

About 2 blocks.

## Feb 4, 2022, 12:35am
Antennas: 5dBi
Power: 23 (maximum) on transmitter, default on receiver
Location: Berkeley
Line of sight: no

Nearly 3 blocks

## Feb 4, 2022, 12:43am
Antennas: Mini 2.5dBi
Power: 23 (maximum) on transmitter, default on receiver
Location: Berkeley
Line of sight: no

Exactly 3 blocks.

## Feb 21, 2022
Antennas: Mini 2.5dBi
Power: 20 (maximum) on transmitter, default on receiver
Location: Noe Valley
Line of sight: no

A little over 3 blocks


# Thoughts
The mini antennas are just straight up better than the big ones. It appears that pointing them up
results in the best range, at least on the transmit side... Presumably the 2.5 dBi sacrifices the
top and bottom in exchange for the sides.
