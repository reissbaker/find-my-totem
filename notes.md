# Tests

## Jan 30, 2022
Antennas: Wire
Power: default
Location: Noe Valley
Line of sight: no

Got about two blocks

## Feb 3, 2022, Test 1
Antennas: Mini 2dBi
Power: default
Location: Berkeley
Line of sight: no

Got about 2 blocks. Not a perfect comparison to Noe Valley since the terrain is different. All
subsequent tests to be carried out in Berkeley.

## Feb 3, 2022, Test 2
Antennas: 5dBi
Power: default
Location: Berkeley
Line of sight: no

About 2 blocks.

## Feb 4, 2022, 12:35am
Antennas: 5dBi
Power: 23 (maximum) on transmitter, default on receiver
Location: Berkeley
Line of sight: no

Nearly 3 blocks

## Feb 4, 2022, 12:43am
Antennas: Mini 2.5dBi
Power: 23 (maximum) on transmitter, default on receiver
Location: Berkeley
Line of sight: no

Exactly 3 blocks.

# Thoughts
I'm not certain there's a meaningful difference between the 2.5dBi antennas and the 5dBi one. That
being said, I'm curious whether rotating the higher-dBi antenna (or even the low-dBi mini one!)
could increase range, after reading about what dBi actually means and how antenna range works.
